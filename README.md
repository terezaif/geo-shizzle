# geo-shizzle
This is the beginning.. the start of our workshop on getting stuff done with geo data in python.. üêç and keeping it simple


## Dataset

[Berlin train stations with accessibility](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze?title=&field_category_tid[]=231&field_license_tid=All&field_publisher_tid=193&field_geo_granularity_tid=All&field_temporal_granularity_tid=All)


## Objective


Presentation: 
- overview of different plotting tools with insight in complexity and quality of output
And of different distance calculations.. Again with insight into complexity / quality
Understanding of how the distances are calculated, when certain distances are more appropriate than others
- With relevant examples of usage
- Understanding of Route vs distance 
- Open Street Map 
- Mapping concepts: Shapes and Tiles

Workshop: 
- Plotting on map and calculating distances with simple ways (beeline/euclidean and I guess manhattan)

Target audience: 
- no prior knowledge of geospatial data required (?)


## Requirements

* python üêç 3.8.5
* pyenv or conda
